North Korea Threatens Nuclear Attack On THIS U.S. City

At the beginning of the week, North Korea issued a threat warning of an “indiscriminate pre-emptive nuclear strike of justice” on Washington and Seoul. The warning was a response to the U.S. – South Korean military drills.

Threats like this are not unusual from North Korea, which has becoming increasingly more aggressive since Kim Jong Un took power in 2011.

The threats have escalated this week after drills started. Pyongyang described them as “invasion drills that will run through April.”

The National Defense Commission in North Korea has also threatened striks against targets in the South, U.S. bases in the Pacific and in the mainland, arguing that enemies “are working with bloodshot eyes to infringe upn the dignity, sovereignty and vital rights” of North Korea.

“If we push the buttons to annihilate the enemies even right now, all bases of provocations will be reduced to seas in flames and ashes in a moment,” the chilling statement read.

This is just one of many indications that world leaders are quickly losing respect for American under Obama’s administration. It is clear that North Korea views the United States as a weak opponent.

What do you think of these threats?
