Government-Run Healthcare Is Secretly Killing Our Veterans

According to recent reports, at least 40 veterans have died while waiting for an appointment within the Veterans Affairs medical system in Phoenix, AZ. Apparently, they were being placed on a secret waiting list, which some believe is a ploy to give the illusion that the Phoenix Veterans Affairs Health Care System is running according to plan.

In reality, however, nearly 1,400 veterans were forced to wait months or even a year to see a doctor. Although the VA has received harsh criticism in the past, the new reports are simply shocking. Apparently, the appointment list was “deliberately put in place to avoid the VA’s own internal rules,” claims Dr. Sam Foote, who retired after 24 years in Phoenix.

Foote explained that in order to avoid the requirement that VA patients be seen within 14 and 30 days, staff was told not to make appointments in computer systems. Instead, Foote claims, “they enter information into the computer and do a screen capture hard copy printout. They then do not save was put into the computer so there’s no record that you were ever here.”

This “system” means that most patients aren’t seen for several months. Not surprisingly, these actions are killing veterans. Like, for example, 71-year-old Navy veteran Thomas Breen who went to the emergency room due to blood in his urine. He was told he had to wait 7 months before being seen. 4 months later, when the Phoenix VA called Breen to schedule his appointment, he had already died.

What do you think of the Phoenix VA’s actions? How should they be punished?
