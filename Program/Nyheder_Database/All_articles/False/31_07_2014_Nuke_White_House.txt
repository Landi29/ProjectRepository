BREAKING: North Korea Threatens To Nuke White House, See How Obama Responds

North Korea has long been accusing the United States of escalating military tensions in the Korean Peninsula, and they have not been quiet about it. Now, it appears that they have actually issued a threat to strike the Pentagon and the White House with a nuclear weapon.

According to reports, Hwang Pyong-So, the director of the General Political Bureau, made the following statement during an address on TV.

“If the US imperialists threaten our sovereignty and survival…our troops will fire our nuclear-armed rockets at the White House and Pentagon—the sources of all evil.”

Although this is not the first time North Korea has threatened the United States, it is disconcerting nonetheless. Many experts believe that North Korea is still some time away from actually developing a nuclear weapon of their own.

What do you think of the threat?
