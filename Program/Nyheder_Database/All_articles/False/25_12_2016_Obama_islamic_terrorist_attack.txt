What Obama Did After Islamic Terrorist Attack In Ohio Will Make You Sick

The United States suffered yet another terrorist attack on Monday, when an ISIS-supporter went on a rage-fueled stabbing spree at Ohio State University, wounding nine people before police shot and killed him.

Of course, Obama wasted no time urging the American people not to blame Islam for the attack, Web Daily reports.

“Our response to this situation matters,” White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest reportedly said during a press briefing. “If we respond to this situation by casting aspersions on millions of people that adhere to a particular religion or if we increase our suspicion of people who practice a particular religion, we are more likely going to contribute to acts of violence than we are to prevent them.”

Earnest added that even though there is evidence the attacker drew inspiration from ISIS, authorities are still investigating his motives.

Earnest’s comments came shortly after law enforcement officials concluded the attacker was “likely inspired by ISIS.” He also posted a suspicious message to Facebook before the attack.

“By Allah, we will not let you sleep unless you give peace to the Muslims. You will not celebrate or enjoy any holiday,” he wrote in the disturbing post. “Btw, every single Muslim who disapproves of my actions is a sleeper cell, waiting for a signal. I am warning you Oh America.”

That sounds like this has something to do with Islam to us…but of course, Obama is more worried about protecting extremists than the people of this country.

What do you think of Obama’s response?
