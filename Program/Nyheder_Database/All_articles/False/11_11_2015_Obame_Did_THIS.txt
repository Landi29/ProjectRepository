80,000 Colorado Citizens Just Lost Their Healthcare After Obama Did THIS

It has become all too apparent that Obamacare is a complete failure. The plan has failed to meet almost every target and expectation it had set.

This year, 80,000 Colorado citizens will lose their health insurance.

Colorados largest health insurer, Colorado HealthOP, is shutting down, forcing 80,000 people out of their insurance.

The insurance company had relied on federal support, and it has recently been announced that the Obama is cutting the funding to them.

How can Obama create a program like this, which so many people were against, and fail to give it the proper support to work?

This program has fallen flat on Obama’s face, just as the rest of his initiatives have. Do you think Obama should be impeached for trying to tear apart America?
