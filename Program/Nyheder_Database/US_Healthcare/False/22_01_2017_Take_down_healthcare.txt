Congress Issues Subpoena In Effort To Take Down Obama’s Healthcare Policy

The House has issued subpoenas to Department of Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, in addition to three IRS officials. They were requested to provide documents of Obama’s unlawful payments to insurance companies, and refused to hand them over. That didn’t sit so well with Congress.

The Subpoenas were issued by House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady. The subpoenas demand the documents be provided by February 3rd.

One chairman said, “What’s the self-proclaimed ‘most transparent administration in history’ trying to hide? Subpoenas should not be necessary to gather basic information about $5 billion in unlawful payments to insurance companies, but the Obama administration has left no choice despite our repeated, good faith efforts. After almost a year of repeated excuses and stonewalling, the public deserves better. At the end of the day, the American public will get answers.”

We couldn’t agree more. Obama hides because what’s kept behind the curtain isn’t pretty. More so, it’s most likely illegal. Obamacare is one of Obama’s worst policies to date, and needs to be repealed immediately. Do you think Obamacare is unlawful?
