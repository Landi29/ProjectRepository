Obama: ‘No Terrorist Has Successfully Executed An Attack On Our Homeland’

This week, President Barack Obama outraged Americans everywhere when he seemed to forget about the terrorist attacks our country has faced in the name of ISIS. Completely overlooking San Bernardino and Orlando, Obama argued that in his eight years of presidency, there had not been an attack on our soil

Of course, this is a massive insult to the families of those who have lost their loved ones because Obama fails to recognize the threat of radical Islamic terrorism to this day. It also doesn’t sit well with the men and women who have put their lives on the line to protect our country overseas.

What do you think? Are you ready for Obama to be out of the White House once and for all?
