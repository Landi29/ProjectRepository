North Korea Launches Satellite Over Super Bowl

Just two days after North Korea launched a satellite that traveled over the Super Bowl, a top American intelligence official has revealed that the nation has restarted their plutonium reactor.

Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told reporters at BBC that North Korea may be “very close to recovering nuclear weapons grade material.”

“We further assess that North Korea has been operating the reactor long enough so that it could begin to recover plutonium from the reactor’s spent fuel within a matter of weeks to months,” Clapper commented.

9 years ago, in 2007, North Korea suspended their nuclear weapons program in exchange for an aid package. Activity picked up once more in 2013 and in January of this year, when North Korea began successfully conducting underground nuclear tests.

Clapper also believes that North Korea is taking steps towards developing their intercontinental ballistic missile capability.

If that’s true, it could mean that the real reason behind their satellite launch on Sunday was for a ballistic missile test.

What do you think? Is this a threat that should be taken very seriously?
