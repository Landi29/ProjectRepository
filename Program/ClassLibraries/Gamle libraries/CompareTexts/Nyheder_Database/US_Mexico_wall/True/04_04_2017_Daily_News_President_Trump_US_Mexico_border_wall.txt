President Trump’s plans for a massive wall covering the U.S.-Mexico border will likely come at a high cost, according to a report.

An analysis by CNN found that when the U.S. last built long stretches of wall, it led to drawn-out legal battles in which the landowners always lost and often got paid significantly below their value.

The government paid $78 million for roughly 600 parcels of land when it last began building stretches of wall in 2006, CNN reported. U.S. Customs and Border Protection still has to shell out another $25 million in unresolved real estate and litigation costs.

Those fees only covered 654 miles of a 2,000-mile border, according to the news network. The government only owns about one-third of the land, according to CNN.

President Trump might face a similar uphill battle as he tries to build towering walls between the two countries — sparking outrage from immigration advocates and people who live along the border.
“I would fight this,” Joseph Hein, whose family ranch would be disrupted by the wall, told CNN. “A lot of us would fight.”

Nearly 680 lawsuits were filed against the government during the last wall battle, according to CNN, which reviewed 442 of the cases.

They focused around eminent domain, in which the government can seize land if it’s in the public interest.

Most of the cases had to do with how much landowners were paid for their parcels, CNN reported. Judges in about 25% of the cases ordered the government to pay plaintiffs more than they originally offered. Many were also settled out of court.

The Department of Justice told CNN that securing land for the wall was part of a “security policy” and landowners would get a “fair market” price for their properties.

Plans for a new wall would also cut properties in half, residents told the network.

At River Bend, a resort in Brownsville, Texas, its managers expect that a hefty part of the property will wind up south of the wall.

“If it did that, 70% of our property would be on the south side of the wall,” Jeremy Barnard, general manager of River Bend, told CNN. "That would affect 15 of our 18 holes of the golf course and over 200 residences."

The government put out a work notice in March that called for a two-part wall covering the entirety of the border.

On the campaign trail, President Trump said Mexico would pay for the wall, but has since indicated Uncle Sam will foot the bill.

Experts estimate that construction of the structure will cost tens of billions of dollars to construct.

The President’s draft budget, which was leaked last month, indicates only about $2.9 billion is earmarked — most of which will come from cuts to key agencies within the Department of Homeland Security.

The wall has faced particular opposition in California, where Gov. Jerry Brown recently compared it to the Berlin Wall.
